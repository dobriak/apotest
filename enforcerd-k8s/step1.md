_TODO: Explain namespaces_

Let's have you log in with your aporeto account. We will automatically create a namespace for you that will have the following format:

`/<your-account>/_training/<session-id>`

Click on the the little arrow right next to the script name to get started:

`/opt/aposetup.sh k8s && source .aporeto`{{execute}}
